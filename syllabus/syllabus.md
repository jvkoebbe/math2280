The information in the table above can be used to contact your instructor. The
best way to reach your instructor is to send an email. If you need to make an
appointment to discuss content or anything else in the course send an
**[email](joe.koebbe@usu.edu)** with a couple of times and days that will fit
your schedule. It is best to meet face-to-face, but Zoom will also work.
Students should expect to make appointments throughout the semester and will be
required as part of the homework assignments. You will be required to do this as
a participation assignment in the first week.

##### Exam Schedule for Math 2280

<hr>

The following list of dates includes the days when we will have scheduled exams.
If an exam is given, there will be no quiz for the week during the exam week.

1. In-Class Midterm 1: Friday, February 2, 2024
2. In-Class Midterm 2: Friday, March 1, 2024
3. In-Class Midterm 3: Friday, April 12, 2024

**Comprehensive Final Exam: Friday,  April 26, 2024, 1:30pm-3:20pm**

Students are required to attend all exams on the days and times specified unless
a USU excused absence is involved. If you are not able to attend the exams, it
would be best to register for the course next semester. USU excused absences
and/or family emergencies must be related to the instructor before the exam date
and time.

##### USU Math 2280 Ordinary Differential Equations Course Description:

<hr>

The official USU catalog course description, as of summer 2023, is the
following:

> **MATH 2280 - Ordinary Differential Equations (QI)**
>
> QI Quantitative Intensive
> 
> 3 credit(s)
>
> This course teaches analytic solution techniques for ordinary differential
> equations. Students learn initial value and boundary value problems and
> applications, higher-order scalar equations, first-order linear systems, and
> Laplace transforms.
> 
> **Prerequisite(s):** MATH 1220 and MATH 2270; with a C- or better
>
> **Repeatable for credit:** No
> 
> **Grade Mode:** Standard

<hr>

##### Textbook Information:

<hr>

The textbook for the course is the following

<pre>
  Title: Ordinary Differential Equations An Introduction to the the Fundamentals
  Author: Kenneth B. Howell
  Edition: 2nd
  Publiser: CRC Press
  ISBN: 978-1-138-60583-1
</pre>

In addition to the textbook, there may be a few documents dealing with course
material needed during the semester. These documents will be posted on the
Canvas page for the course or a link will be provided on the Canvas page for the
course. Also, if additional readings and documents are required, the links
and/or documents needed will be described during lectures.

A few remarks:

1. The book has been well received by students enrolled in Math 2280. Comments
   from students in evaluations for the course indicate that the author has
   included good examples of how to solve ordinary differential equations. 
2. The textbook contains more material than can possibly be covered in a
   semester. We will likely need to skip some sections to make progress through
   the course. The idea will be to cover foundational ideas in the solution of
   ordinary differential equations.
3. There will be a large number of problems included in a section by section
   problem list. All of the problems assigned for homework will be taken from
   the textbook. It is best if you choose to work problems until you understand
   the algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations.

##### Instructor Comments about the Course

<hr>

This course is intended for undergraduate students in science and engineering
programs. Most real world models of interest to engineers and scientists involve
the use of differential equations in a fundamental way. Physical problems like
fluid flow are best modeled through rates of change in the mass or volume at a
point in a domain, which in the limit, create derivatives. So, we will end up
with equations that involve the derivatives of unknown function or functions.

1. The course meets three days per week. We will be covering a lot of material
   in each and every class meeting.
2. Although role will not be taken, students are required to attend this course
   in the sense that lectures will not be repeated. Students are expected to
   attend all classes and participate in discussions during class time. Time
   will be taken in each lecture to answer questions about material previously
   presented and any questions about homework.
3. Students who are in need of accommodations should contact appropriate people 
   including your instructor to identify issues. For example, students in need
   of accommodations should contact the DRC on campus as soon as possible.
4. It is highly recommended that students take notes during class to keep up
   with the material presented and to keep up with the lectures.
5. Be on time! Most students in this course will take professional jobs that
   require an employee be on time to work, for meetings, or honoring deadlines.
   This course is no different.

If you have any questions about the course material, course policies, or any
other matters, please contact the instructor for the course via email, before
or after class, or during office hours.

##### Grading:

<hr>

Your grade in the course will be determined by the following:

1. Each student is required to meet with the instructor in the instructor's
   office during the first week of the semester and prior to exams described
   below during posted office hours or by making an appointment. Each required
   visit will count as one homework assignment. You can view this as a course
   participation assignment. You will be required to do this 3 times during the
   semester. Your instructor will give windows of time for each of the visit.
2. Homework will account for a 7.5% of a student's grade. Homework must be
   turned in by the last lecture each week - that would be Friday (or the last
   day of the week) each week of the semester. Under normal conditions late
   homework will not be accepted. If you must be gone, any homework must be
   turned in on or before the due date. The only exception to this rule is if a
   family emergency occurs during the semester.
3. Weekly quizzes will be administered the last day of lecture each week. The
   problems selected for quizzes will be taken directly from the assigned
   homework for the week. Quizzes will account for 7.5% of a student's grade in
   the course.
4. Three midterms will be given. Each will cover about one fourth of the content   of the course. Each of these midterms will account for 15% or 45% of the
   grade earned in the course.
5. A comprehensive final exam will be administered during finals week. This exam
   will account for 40% of a students grade in the course.

If students have questions about grading please contact your instructor. One of
the assignments will be to meet with your instructor at least twice during the
semester. Any concerns about the course can be expressed at these meetings.

##### Final Grade Scale:

<hr>

The final grade received in class will be determined using the following table:

| Normalized Total Score | Letter Grade |
| ---------------------: | :----------- |
| 94-100                 | A            |
| 90-94                  | A-           |
| 87-90                  | B+           |
| 83-87                  | B            |
| 80-83                  | B-           |
| 77-80                  | C+           |
| 70-87                  | C            |
| 67-70                  | D+           |
| 60-67                  | D            |
| 0-60                   | F            |

The final grade will be the best possible in the table above. So, if your total normalized points amounts to 79.98 the grade will be rounded up to 80 which according to the table will be B-
